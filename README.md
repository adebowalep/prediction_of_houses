	<h1>Introduction:</h1>
	<p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices in King County, USA, using a dataset with 18 features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, etc. and the target variable house price. The project uses different machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and XGBoost, to develop the model. The effectiveness of each model is analyzed and improvements are outlined. The project also includes visualizing the data set, performing exploratory data analysis, building a pipeline, doing feature engineering, saving the best model using pickle, and assessing the effectiveness of the model.</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>To run this project, Python 3.6 or higher and the following libraries are required: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost, and plotly. To install these libraries, use the following command:</p>
<code>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn xgboost plotly</code>

<h2>Project Structure:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>houseprice_data.csv: the dataset used for house price prediction.</li>
	<li>house_price_prediction.ipynb: the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the project code.</li>
	<li>README.md: the file that you are reading right now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions to Run the Project:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Clone the repository to your local system.</li>
	<li>Open the Jupyter Notebook file house_price_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.</li>
	<li>Run the notebook cell by cell to execute the project code.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Steps followed in the Project:</h2>

	<li>Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.</li>
	<li>Build a pipeline and perform feature engineering.</li>
	<li>Build the model using linear regression, polynomial regression, and XGBoost.</li>
	<li>Save the best model using pickle.</li>
	<li>Assess the effectiveness of the model.</li>
	<li>Include as many features as possible to see how the model improves.</li>
	<li>Improve the performance of the model.</li>
	<li>Make a conclusion on which model performs the best.</li>
	<li>Deploy the machine learning pipeline using Google Kubernetes Engine through GCP, Kubernetes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The house price prediction project is aimed at predicting house prices in King County, USA, using different machine learning algorithms. The project code is available in the Jupyter Notebook file house_price_prediction.ipynb. The project follows a step-by-step approach and includes visualizing the data set, performing EDA, building a pipeline, doing feature engineering, building the model, saving the best model, assessing the effectiveness of the model, and deploying the machine learning pipeline using Google Kubernetes Engine through GCP, Kubernetes. The project aims to find the best model that can predict house prices with high accuracy.</p>
